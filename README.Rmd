
The run_anlysis.R script performs the following steps to create a tidy data set.

1. It assigns each dataset to a data frame where:

  features <- features.txt  
    The features selected come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ.
    
  activities <- activity_labels.txt  
    List of activities performed when the corresponding measurements were taken and its codes 
    
  subject_test <- test/subject_test.txt 
    contains test data of the 30 volunteer test subjects being observed
    
  x_test <- test/X_test.txt  
    contains recorded features of the test data
    
  y_test <- test/y_test.txt  
    contains test data of activities'code labels
    
  subject_train <- test/subject_train.txt 
    contains train data of 21/30 volunteer subjects being observed
    
  x_train <- test/X_train.txt 
    contains recorded features of train data
    
  y_train <- test/y_train.txt  
    contains train data of activities'code labels

2. It merges the training and the test sets to create one data set
    x is created by merging x_train and x_test using rbind() function
    y is created by merging y_train and y_test using rbind() function
    sub is created by merging subject_train and subject_test using rbind() function
    merge is created by merging sub,y and x using cbind() function

3. It extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
    tidy is created by subsetting merge, selecting only columns: subject, activityID and the measurements on the mean and standard deviation     (std) for each measurement

4. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    Entire numbers in code column of the tidy dataframe are replaced with corresponding activity taken from second column of the                activities variable

5. It re-labels the data set with descriptive variable names
    code column in tidy renamed into activities
    All Acc in column's name replaced by Accelerometer
    All Gyro in column's name replaced by Gyroscope
    All BodyBody in column's name replaced by Body
    All Mag in column's name replaced by Magnitude
    All start with character f in column's name replaced by Frequency
    All start with character t in column's name replaced by Time

6. From the data set in step 4, it creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
